 Simple Calculator course project

Created this during the free Frontend Masters *Complete Intro to Web Dev V3*.  It's  great course!  It's a killer refresher if you already have some knowldge. It is geared to new coder. So you might end-up speeding up play back a bit.  Don't skip things though, because Brian Holt drops a lot of wisdome nuggets too.

Calcualtor logic is all me. HTML and CSS are pretty much straight from the examples he provides.  The emphais of the project was to work on scripting -- not so much the HTML/CSS. 

I already have some ideas for refactoring, but I am going to set it aside for now and press on.
